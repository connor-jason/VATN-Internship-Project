## Features

- **Real-Time Status Indicators**: Utilizes green checks and red X's to provide immediate visual feedback on system statuses, enabling users to quickly identify any issues.
- **Dark Theme Interface**: Implements a dark-themed design that enhances text readability and reduces eye strain, especially in low-light environments.
- **Intuitive Data Visualization**:
  - **Vehicle Odom**: Incorporates visual bars and directional arrows to represent heading, pitch, roll, and depth, allowing users to grasp complex data at a glance.
  - **Formatted Coordinates**: Displays latitude and longitude in degrees and minutes format for improved intuitiveness and alignment with navigational standards.
- **Lightweight Implementation**: Avoids the use of heavy packages, libraries, and external APIs to maintain a fast and responsive dashboard, adhering to performance optimization best practices.
- **State Persistence**: Employs `localStorage` to preserve component states across page reloads, ensuring a consistent user experience.

## Design Decisions

- **Visual Status Indicators**:
  - **Green Checks and Red X's**: Chosen to provide clear and immediate visual cues about the operational status of various systems. This color-coding enhances user ability to monitor system health efficiently.
  
- **Dark Theme**:
  - **Enhanced Readability**: Selected a dark color scheme to improve text visibility and reduce glare, making it easier for users to read information for extended periods.
  
- **Data Visualization Enhancements**:
  - **Directional Arrows and Progress Bars**: Integrated into the Vehicle Odom component to represent heading, pitch, roll, and depth visually. These elements allow users to understand complex data quickly without interpreting raw numbers.
  
- **Formatted Latitude and Longitude**:
  - **Degrees and Minutes Format**: Adopted a more intuitive format for displaying geographic coordinates, aligning with common navigational practices and improving overall user comprehension.
  
- **Minimalist Dependencies**:
  - **Performance Optimization**: Deliberately avoided using bulky packages and external APIs to keep the application lightweight. This decision reduces load times and minimizes potential points of failure, ensuring a smoother user experience.
  
- **State Management with `localStorage`**:
  - **Persistence Across Reloads**: Implemented `localStorage` to store fetched data, allowing the dashboard to retain its state even after the page is refreshed. This enhances usability by providing continuity in data presentation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 12 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **yarn**
- **Git** (to clone the repository)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/VATN-Internship-Project.git
```

Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd vessel-autonomy-dashboard
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Or if you're using yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

Start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

This command will start the application and open it in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 5. Build for Production (Optional)

To create a production build of the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

The optimized build will be output to the `build` directory.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following major dependencies:

- **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **npm start** - Runs the app in development mode.
- **npm test** - Launches the test runner.
- **npm run build** - Builds the app for production.
